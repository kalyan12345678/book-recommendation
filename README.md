# book-recommendation
The Book Recommendation System is an intelligent algorithm which reduces the overhead of the people. This provides benefit to both the seller and the consumer creating the win-win situation. In the project we use K-NN algorithm which is one of the simplest Machine Learning algorithms based on Supervised Learning technique. This algorithm assumes the similarity between the new case/data and available cases and put the new case into the category that is most similar to the available categories.
